            "description": "The Purple-faced Langur (Semnopithecus vetulus) is a captivating primate species exclusively found in Sri Lanka, showcasing distinctive features that set it apart in the realm of wildlife. Its most notable characteristic is the striking purple hue adorning its face, contrasting sharply with its sleek black fur coat. Typically measuring between 42 to 61 centimeters in body length and sporting a tail ranging from 60 to 75 centimeters, these medium-sized Old World monkeys captivate observers with their unique appearance. Endemic to Sri Lanka, they primarily inhabit rainforests, montane forests, and hilly regions, often occupying the upper canopy where they feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers. Social animals, Purple-faced Langurs form groups of varying sizes, employing a range of vocalizations for communication. Despite their visual allure, these langurs face threats such as habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and hunting. Conservation initiatives and protected areas strive to mitigate these challenges and preserve the Purple-faced Langur's significance within Sri Lanka's rich biodiversity."
